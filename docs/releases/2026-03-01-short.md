- Improved GitHub integration with promoted-action issue sync, period-based deduplication, and rate-limit retry handling.
- Added schema governance with `schema_version` and JSON schema compatibility checks in CI.
- Extended dashboard views for issue-sync monitoring and weekly failure diagnostics.

## Security & Operations
- Audited commit scope for secret leakage; no real credentials found.
